Volcado is a plug and play digital forensics tool which helps investigation officers with the forensics process by automating it.

Provides features like data forensics that can be a valuable tool for forensic investigations, debugging, and troubleshooting

Incorporating basic features also to provide users a powerful and versatile tool.

Will create a RAM dump smartly which will be useful when available RAM is limited(Filtering dump).

Not only will collect the data, it can analyse it on a personalised demanded level.

We will try to make it untech-savvy friendly. 

Assurance of privacy and security.

Removes the problem of time-zone.

Algos inside
Signature-based detection: This approach involves comparing the contents of the RAM dump to a database of known malware signatures. If a match is found, the software can identify the malware and take appropriate action.(YARA)

Heuristics-based detection: This approach involves analyzing the behavior of the processes and network connections in the RAM dump to identify suspicious activity that may be indicative of malware.(ClamAV)

Machine learning-based detection: This approach involves using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in the RAM dump that are indicative of malware. This can include techniques such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection.(Random Forest)

Dynamic analysis: This approach involves executing the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its behavior to identify its capabilities and intentions.
(Cuckoo Sandbox)

Memory forensics: This approach involves analyzing the memory dump to extract artifacts such as processes, network connections, and registry keys, which can provide insights into the behavior of the malware.(Volatility)
